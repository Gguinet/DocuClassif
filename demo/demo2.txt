Europa is one of Jupiter’s four large Galilean moons. 
And in a paper published Monday in the Astrophysical Journal, 
Dr. Batygin and a co-author, Alessandro Morbidelli, 
a planetary scientist at the Côte d’Azur Observatory in France, 
present a theory explaining how some moons form around gas giants like 
Jupiter and Saturn, suggesting that millimeter-sized grains of hail 
produced during the solar system’s formation became trapped 
around these massive worlds, taking shape one at a time into 
the potentially habitable moons we know today.
